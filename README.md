# DSCI330 Final Project: Sentiment Analysis-Integrated Therapist Chatbot

For my final project in DSCI330: Cognition and Computation, I created a chatbot that is supposed to interact with the user like a therapist. It is integrated with a word2vec sentiment analysis model, and the color of the response messages from the model changes on a red -> green gradient based on the positivity score assigned to the user's input message.
